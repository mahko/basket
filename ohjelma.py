# Basket is a simple class for a MVP stage shopping application
# You can make a new basket by adding a name, list of products and a price
# You can return the name of the customer, the contents of the basket and the price
# You can add items later as well
# You can count the new price if you have a discount

# TODO: exception handling, user input...
